## Operations Dashboard PRD/TRD traceability

| Requirement | Evidence contract | Delivery state |
|---|---|---|
| Claim cause delay: order, specification change, originating order, sales pool, Event/post counts | ADR 0206; contextual-orchestrator case classification and `claim_received` → `cause_confirmed` milestones with cited spans and observed source clocks | Stacked candidate reports open/resolved/evidence-missing counts and exact elapsed time only for paired observed endpoints; every required answer and endpoint is cited or explicitly missing; authenticated synthetic runtime passed, while authorized-corpus re-analysis remains pending |
| Rebid/handover: discussion, counterparties, our owner, decisions, Event/post counts | ADR 0206; normalized case facts plus separate rebid-response and handover milestone pairs | Stacked candidate reports open/resolved/evidence-missing rebid and handover lifecycles without a delay threshold or invented elapsed endpoint; authenticated synthetic runtime passed, while authorized-corpus re-analysis remains pending |
| External information count/rate and sales/project relation | ADR 0206; semantic `external_information` classification inside Dashboard GNB | Candidate GNB destination filters the Dashboard to external evidence; no separate Board by product decision; authenticated synthetic runtime passed with the honest zero-result state |
| Project-specific journey | Explicit source/semantic project membership plus provenance-bearing TEPP TDT/CHRONOS predecessor, branch, and transition results | Candidate API preserves every explicit project membership, but its local event-time sort is only an observed-event list. It is no longer labeled as a Project Journey. Full journey delivery remains open until the accepted TEPP producer artifact is persisted and rendered; no fixed sales/order start or nearest-date edge is accepted. |
| Repeat issue to design improvement | `repeat_issue`, `issue_pattern`, and `improvement_action` cited facts | Candidate semantic contract; design-system connector acceptance pending |
| Natural-language Ask with evidence, report, alert, MCP | Persisted semantic-unit embeddings plus versioned delivery/resource contract | Candidate implementation uses whole-question embedding retrieval with no lexical fallback; authenticated runtime acceptance pending |
| Similar VOC, customer cohort, prior action | Persisted repeat-issue candidate semantics plus orchestrator pair adjudication and extractive evidence | Candidate live post endpoint and post-detail UI implemented; authenticated runtime acceptance pending |
| TEPP independent Event Lineage anchor | Accepted, persisted TEPP criterion bound to exact snapshot/cutoff before fast-mlsirm activation | Consumer PR #606 is on protected main; TEPP producer PR #237 remains open, so no end-to-end accepted artifact is release evidence yet |
| Temporal Lineage topics and multilevel important posts | ADR 0210; TEPP posterior topic/plausible-value contract followed by fast-mlsirm observed-information case-deletion influence | This stacked candidate adds normalized persistence, exact run/snapshot/cutoff binding, pre-aggregation scope authorization, API diagnostics, and populated/unavailable Storybook surfaces. TEPP PR #247 remains open at `063f10f3`; stacked #251–#254 provide fail-closed input validation, full joint precision, deterministic joint plausible-value draws, and the canonical research register, while complete provenance assembly remains gated. fast-mlsirm PR #1418 validates the Rust consumer envelope but intentionally returns `EstimatorUnavailable` until the scientific estimator lands. Runtime therefore remains honestly unavailable with no local Python or fallback score. |

### Technical contract and flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Source as Authorized source_post
  participant CO as contextual-orchestrator
  participant Case as operations_case_* (3NF)
  participant TEPP as TEPP criterion run
  participant MLS as fast-mlsirm
  participant API as Dashboard/Ask API
  Source->>CO: semantic units + lineage + ontology context
  CO-->>Case: cases, cited facts, session provenance
  Source->>TEPP: versioned snapshot and independent criterion
  TEPP-->>MLS: exact accepted anchor only
  MLS-->>API: anchored vector or unavailable
  Case-->>API: ABAC-filtered evidence and counts
```

Security/operability: every aggregation applies `post_read` plus row-level
corporate-entity visibility before counting; source-body digests invalidate
stale inference; provider errors persist no positive/negative result; PII
remains authorized at the UI boundary and is excluded from telemetry. The
tables use composite keys and bounded kind-first indexes; production hot-path
acceptance still requires `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` on an anonymized runtime
snapshot.

### Historical UI audit evidence

The `f0b96029` Storybook build was rendered at 1440×1100 and 402×1200 with
synthetic evidence; `416fd19d` changes only post-navigation request isolation.
Desktop inspection showed all four case kinds, five non-conflated metrics,
project-observed-event ordering, cited facts, and evidence actions without horizontal
card overflow. Narrow inspection showed two-column metrics, readable cards and
44px-class actions; the project event list remains intentionally horizontally
scrollable. No identifying runtime record or screenshot is committed. The
`EvidenceReady`, `NarrowViewport`, `AnalysisPendingAndMissingEvidence`,
`AnalysisFailed`, and `LoadError` scenes cover the ADR 0206 state inventory.
The current #640 candidate adds `ExternalInformationEmpty`; its Storybook
build was inspected at 1440×1000 and 390×844 and exposes neither corpus-wide
total/pending/failed counts nor a misleading corpus failure alert in that scoped
destination. Screenshots remain local synthetic audit evidence and are not
committed.
The stacked topic-context consumer adds `TopicInfluenceAccepted` and the
unavailable topic section in `EvidenceReady`. Synthetic screenshots were
inspected at 1440×1200 and 390×844. At 390px the page had zero document-level
horizontal overflow while each exact-value table retained its named,
keyboard-focusable 332px viewport over 784px of table content. The new source
actions measured 54px high; sampled heading, caption, and table-header contrast
was 20.15:1, 5.73:1, and 18.62:1. Authenticated runtime evidence remains
required before protected delivery can be claimed.
Authenticated authorized-corpus acceptance remains separate and may return
only aggregate, non-identifying evidence to this repository.

The current candidate was also re-rendered from the isolated synthetic stack
at 1440×1100 and 402×1200 after the touch-target repair. Both viewports had
document width equal to viewport width, no browser console/page errors, and no
visible button or link below the shared 24px WCAG 2.2 minimum target token.
The screenshots remain local `/tmp` audit artifacts and are not committed.

At the repaired dashboard head, the `EvidenceReady` and `NarrowViewport`
stories were re-rendered locally with synthetic data at desktop and iPhone
13 viewports. The desktop shows separate Event/post values and evidence
actions; the narrow view preserves readable cards and 44px-class actions while
keeping the multi-step project event list horizontally scrollable. These images
remain local audit evidence and are not committed.
An authenticated synthetic OIDC audit then found that the mobile breakpoint
hid the entire GNB despite having no drawer implementation. Candidate
`6b195171` keeps the same semantic navigation in a keyboard-accessible
horizontal viewport. The 390×844 rerender showed the GNB, one `main`, zero
unnamed controls, no document-level horizontal overflow, and visible keyboard
focus. Candidate `1fb65c2e` fixed the root cause of the isolated 401: Compose
passed canonical `VITE_KEYVERSE_*` build arguments while the frontend image
consumed different names and silently compiled the default issuer. A fresh OIDC
browser context then rendered the authenticated synthetic Dashboard at
1440×1000 and 390×844 with 27 total posts, one classified Event/post, 24
pending analyses, zero failures, and honest unavailable TEPP/fast-mlsirm
producer contracts. Both viewports had one `main`, one navigation landmark,
zero unnamed controls, visible first-tab focus, no document horizontal
overflow, no console errors, and no HTTP 4xx/5xx. Screenshots remain local and
uncommitted.
The same candidate then ran the complete Python/backend suite with
`DeprecationWarning` promoted to an error: 1,372 tests passed and 17 declared
integration/provider tests skipped. The run exposed one stale async-queue test
that implicitly depended on unavailable semantic retrieval; the repaired test
injects the queue computation boundary, while dedicated retrieval tests retain
the no-keyword, fail-closed embedding contract. Starlette's maintained
`httpx2` TestClient dependency and FastAPI's RFC 9110 422 constant remove the
observed deprecations without suppression. This remains local exact-head
regression evidence, not hosted-gate or protected-main evidence.

### Exact open-PR boundary

At this snapshot there were 11 open PRs and 10 open issues. The exact-head
inventory in section 1 is authoritative for this snapshot. Every open head
remained blocked on hosted gates and/or independent review. These observations
are not merge readiness. Re-fetch exact heads,
unresolved threads, checks, approvals, rulesets, and merge SHA before any
lifecycle claim.

## 1. Exact-head and governance evidence

The protected default branch was `494b54e2245040bcf02b45376f221c37cd437e76`
when this baseline was refreshed. The live queue contained 11 open PRs and 10
open issues. The exact-head inventory below supersedes older per-PR snapshots
elsewhere in this document; those older rows remain useful historical delivery
context only.

| PR | Exact observed head | Merge/check state at this snapshot |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| #681 | `3e0fa644` | stacked fast-mlsirm pair-posterior contract pin; exact-head checks queued and independent review required |
| #667 | `425de329` | current governance/gap evidence refresh; exact-head checks and independent review required |
| #663 | `e65fd29c` | consolidates project ontology traversal and #632 content; exact-head checks and independent review required |
| #658 | `f497a6e8` | evidence-honest Global Ask cutoff with revision-interval live-after semantics |
| #657 | `a59a2023` | fail-closed TEPP asynchronous lifecycle persistence; executable producer evidence remains required |
| #644 | `ed8d97f3` | native-surface code splitting with modal-focus regression coverage |
| #643 | `7fb4d18c` | accessible status-notice surfaces |
| #640 | `d314855c` | operations-dashboard contract alignment; exact-head checks queued and independent review required |
| #639 | `8da485d3` | exact-head checks and independent review required |
| #632 | `cad4debf` | semantic provenance repair structurally included by #663 |
| #631 | `e6b4f0c4` | documentation-only queue snapshot requires current-main refresh or closure |
| #629 | `c95f931d` | exact-head checks and independent review required |

No row above is merge evidence. Immediately before any lifecycle action,
re-fetch the head, unresolved threads, formal reviews, rulesets, and same-head
check conclusions. In particular, queued checks are infrastructure state and
do not transfer evidence from an earlier SHA.

PR #664 merged as `b2e48d5b0db59f5aa434e2a293cd182ee810c019`
into #660's non-default branch. Its semantic-unit implementation is therefore
stack evidence only until #660 passed protected `main` through merge
`7e9030c9a8ee2684e680c63013b304b435ba646e`; the subsequent ontology
readability stack reached protected `main` as `494b54e2245040bcf02b45376f221c37cd437e76`.

PR #607 first merged as `61fd631c7bb3c57113fd19763c2c43161eeb2824`
into #606's non-default branch. PR #606 subsequently passed the protected gate,
so the combined TEPP-consumer and operations-dashboard implementation is now
on `main`; the still-open TEPP producer PR #237 keeps end-to-end anchor
acceptance unavailable.

PR #604 was closed unmerged after its exact OIDC repair was composed into #605;
its green or pending checks are not delivery evidence. PR #482 merged as
protected-main commit `464ff25002044b9d933c8eefd36c8def7ca0ffd8`
with package conflict markers, identifying baseline records, and an OIDC
return-context regression. PR #603 repaired the package/privacy and
analysis-run transaction defects through protected main at `4f53190b`; the
OIDC defect remains delivered until #604 or the composed #605 passes the
protected gate. Protected main is therefore not yet a release candidate.

PR #592 first merged as `3b3af3b4fe9c439354433a43444e05f37ab24ea3`
into #590's non-default stack base at `2f033ba3`. The complete stack then
passed the protected gate and #590 merged to `main` as
`1d1379fc59d9dac6e9c8bfa4812313e3b9e8f3c8`.

PR #521 merged through protected `main` as
`3797f063b1a7396972a749aa81f23745acccbee1`; it is release evidence and no
longer part of the open queue. That merge also left a standalone conflict
marker and duplicated stale tail in `CLAUDE.md`; #594 repaired it through
protected `main` as `241be2dddf657f854cb8be54fe11d4ef48d37976`.

Protected main now contains the ADR 0109 OIDC return restoration from #605,
including fragment preservation and storage fallback. The #606 dashboard
landing must additionally route `?post=` deep links to the Board; that focused
regression is part of the current candidate and is not delivery evidence yet.

Three systemic gates currently dominate the queue:

1. **Strix visibility lookup failure (org control plane).** PR #600 exact head
   `7580bdc9` failed before scanning because the required-workflow token could
   not resolve this public repository after six API retries. The root repair is
   ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1320 at `3b9b2380`: ordinary PR, push, and
   schedule runs use trusted event visibility; cross-repository dispatch keeps
   authoritative public/private/internal visibility; private and internal
   repositories remain on private-capable providers. The exact head also
   composes the executable fallback contract and classifies bounded NVIDIA
   `ServiceUnavailableError` overload evidence as retryable across configured
   distinct models without weakening exhaustion or vulnerability fail-close.
   A hosted fallback then completed with zero vulnerabilities but was rejected
   because the generic warning gate treated Strix's fallback-model banner and
   a Hugging Face unauthenticated-download notice as provider failures. The
   current head removes only those two exact scanner notices before the
   existing general warning and explicit 429/provider failure checks. The
   current head also clears a foreign NVIDIA/OpenRouter endpoint before a
   direct-OpenAI fallback while retaining an explicitly configured
   direct-OpenAI primary endpoint. The prior full quick-gate harness, overload
   path, 12 visibility-contract tests, and the focused cross-provider endpoint
   contract passed; exact-head hosted revalidation remains pending. It is blocked on
   hosted exact-head gates and independent review, so no repaired
   protected-main Strix runtime evidence exists yet.
2. **Strix provider unavailability (org control plane).** The central required
   Strix scan on .github#1320 failed when NVIDIA returned `Service temporarily
   overloaded`; the gate correctly failed closed but did not try its configured
   distinct fallbacks because the service-unavailable classifier excluded the
   NVIDIA provider. Exact head `3b9b2380` composes that execution repair and the
   two exact non-fatal scanner-notice exclusions while keeping
   incomplete exhaustion non-passing. This is still an unmerged control-plane
   proposal, not protected-main or downstream runtime evidence.
3. **Current-head independent approval.** The org merge scheduler requires
   `reviewDecision == APPROVED` plus complete Strix evidence on the exact
   head. Bot review evidence regenerates per push, so any repair push resets
   the review clock by design; this is expected and not a bypass target.

This documentation is owned by protected `main` again: the #426 stack landed,
so hidden-stack merges (#494, #497, #499, #505, #509 into unprotected parent
branches) are historical context only and no longer gate anything.

The current protected-`main` and exact #507 trees are clean of the private
runtime source-table identifier present in the closed #506 head and older
public history. Do not reproduce or hint at its value. Historical remediation
requires the ADR 0001 incident process and security/privacy-owner coordination;
never force-push or delete evidence ad hoc.

The Grok durable hourly loop and the central thin GitHub Actions caller
ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1259 (minute 4, `pr-review-fix-scheduler.yml`)
both target this repository. Do not add a LineageWeave-local duplicate
workflow. ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1258 merged at exact head `897819c4` to
repair the pnpm/coverage-evidence workflow; newly created exact PR heads must
still prove the runtime behavior because merged workflow source alone is not
check evidence.

Figma design-system boundary (ADR 0002): File ID `1Su3lDRmiZdcUs47t1QwIX`.
The sanitized file now contains synthetic Event Lineage desktop (`5:14`) and
mobile (`5:15`) frames with graph direction, event dates, an inference
boundary, and exact fused-score evidence. Do not copy source-organization
content into this repository. Storybook remains the executable scene and
edge-case inventory for repeated web objects; rendered code-to-Figma parity
still requires same-viewport browser comparison on an exact candidate head.

## 2. User-visible capability baseline

Substantially present on protected `main`:

- PostgreSQL-backed import, normalized provenance, cutoff-aware analysis runs,
  source revisions, lineage reconstruction, and explicit unavailable states.
- Authenticated workspace navigation, post detail, localized summaries, 5W1H,
  R&R/Keyman, evidence citations, chat, organization hierarchy, and lineage DAG
  (`frontend/src/LineageDag.tsx` is on `main`; the old “DAG view missing”
  baseline entry is stale).
- Semantic paragraph/list/table/image-region units that preserve the source
  representation and provenance instead of flattening it into one body string.
- Contextual-orchestrator boundaries for adjudication, extraction, summaries,
  chat, embeddings, and VISION; null channels remain unavailable and are
  dropped from score fusion.
- W3C PROV-O projection through normalized provenance tables, with the
  knowledge graph retained as an explicit navigation projection.
- Keyverse/Keycloak OIDC, RankWeave fusion port, TEPP measurement client,
  ThreadWeave tree assembly.

These statements describe source capability, not authenticated production
corpus acceptance or protected release.

## 3. Historical open-PR inventory (superseded by §1)

Heads below are queue evidence captured at snapshot time; recheck SHA,
checks, unresolved threads, and independent approval immediately before any
merge claim. Do not self-approve, force-push, or transfer stale review
evidence across heads. The org merge scheduler merges only when
`reviewDecision == APPROVED` on the exact head and Strix evidence is complete.

### 3.0 Shared systemic gate

| Gate | Evidence | Durable repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strix provider unavailability | `nvidia_nim/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` and `openai-direct/gpt-5.6-luna` failed authoritatively across unrelated heads | ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1263 at `ab3d7645` proposes executable Azure/cross-provider fallbacks but remains open/conflicting; repair that branch without weakening the required gate |
| ADR 0109 login repair debt | Eight branches cut from the pre-repair base carried the unauthenticated `AdminPanel` + unused-OIDC-helper `tsc -b` failure | Same verified two-line repair applied to #521, #522, #552, #553, #554, #556, #558, #560 during this loop; frontend lint/test/build verified locally |

| #564 | `ac5de72a` | Name leftover-map reconstruction share (v2.12.30) |

The leftover-map naming series (#518–#564) is a stacked ladder of honest
leftover-pair labeling increments; merge in ascending order once each exact
head clears gates.

## 4. Open issues (complete live queue; product acceptance remaining on `main`)

| Issue | User-visible gap | Active PR |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| #79 | Milestone 2: port verified direct-PostgreSQL analysis into the protected architecture | analysis-run registry on `main`; remaining runtime bridge |
| #87 | Milestone 2.1 normalized runtime-analysis schema bridge | related analysis-run work |
| #269 | Authenticated Global Ask MCP browser-safe and admission-bounded | Ask stack |

| #289 | Activate the optional lineage LLM channel through a bounded asynchronous rebuild | #434 |
| #336 | Replace pseudo-CalDAV feed with a Naruon-owned calendar projection | Contract on `main` (#355); operator consume wiring in historical branch `feat/naruon-calendar-buyer-wiring-v2170` |

## 5. Open product and technical gaps

| Gap | Current evidence | Acceptance requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protected release | 11 open PRs at the 07:26 KST snapshot; the exact-head inventory in section 1 records their current evidence boundaries | Terminal exact-head checks, no unresolved threads, independent exact-head approvals, protected squash-merge SHA |
| Evidence-grounded operations workspace | Protected-main #614 delivers governed semantic Ask, live Similar VOC, disjoint pending/failed analysis metrics, full Storybook state inventory, and current desktop/mobile screenshot evidence. Authorized-corpus backfill acceptance remains unavailable | Perform authenticated authorized-corpus acceptance with aggregate evidence and retain fail-closed no-match behavior |
| Shared frontend gate | The ADR 0109 login repair is on protected `main`; eight older branches carried the defect and received the same verified repair this loop (#521–#560) | Keep every future branch cut from post-repair bases; re-verify with frontend lint/test/build before push |
| Identifying baseline regression | `main` gap file listed real post identifiers; separately, closed #506 and pre-existing public history contain a private runtime source-table identifier, while current `main` and #507 trees are clean | Land this non-identifying rewrite, then coordinate ADR 0001 history remediation with security/privacy owners; do not reproduce the value, force-push, or delete evidence ad hoc |
| Authorized-corpus runtime | Repository tests use synthetic fixtures; private records remain outside git | Authenticated runtime validation returning only aggregate, non-identifying evidence |
| Concurrent web responsiveness | ADR 0204 releases pooled transactions during provider work. Candidate `361641ec` completed a freshly built, isolated, authenticated 4-VU/30-second k6 run over 27 synthetic posts: 3,898 requests, 0 failures, HTTP p95 194.70 ms, reader p95 204.06 ms, and Ask enqueue 104.90 ms. Earlier candidate observations remain in the operability record. These are local correctness/concurrency observations, not a product guarantee | Repeat on the protected merge SHA and a representative deployment/corpus with declared CPU, memory, database pool, worker concurrency, and raw output; approve an SLO only from that capacity evidence |
| Image understanding | Region, OCR, and description work exists across active heads (#405, #419), but current runtime acceptance has not yet proved table-image structure, complete region coverage, or summary/image readiness together | Orchestrator-backed rendered workflow, original/derived asset provenance, region-before-OCR processing, and honest unsupported states; reconcile ADR 0052's image-bearing summary readiness with ADR 0098 before changing sequencing |
| Semantic source rendering | ADR 0223 and migration 0221 give new paragraph, list, table, MathML formula, and caller-parsed conversation-turn units explicit persisted kinds without rewriting historical rows; image regions remain ordered normalized children under ADR 0091. This branch is candidate evidence, not protected-main delivery | Land the exact-head candidate, then prove an authorized semantic-only query retrieves each persisted unit kind and gather authenticated browser evidence that nesting, continuation alignment, formula units, and image regions retain source order |
| Event and project semantics | Multi-project mentions, project-bound actions, 5W1H, requester/processor, and semantic relations exist in ADR 0036/0052/0100/0111/0129 and active stacks | Aggregate authenticated evidence must show distinct projects and events, explicit requester/processor and real R&R, normalized relative time, and product/entity relations without promoting attendance or co-occurrence |
| Knowledge Graph readability | The black evidence-node root cause is an undefined-token fallback; the design-token repair and long-label/evidence-table coverage remain only on closed, unmerged #490, not protected `main` | Recreate the token repair on a current base and deliver it through protected `main`, then verify light/dark contrast, keyboard graph navigation, full labels, and evidence tables in the authenticated rendered surface |
| Source-code lookup UX | Source state/detail codes remain evidence-bearing machine values and current detail presentation is dense | Catalog-backed display labels with raw-code provenance, compact 5W1H/source-detail hierarchy, keyboard access, and no unsupported customer/project binding |
| Calendar / Naruon | #355 delivered the projection contract; v2.17.0 wires operator consumption without forwarding the end-user token. Naruon producer, provider/consumer fixtures, and protected merge remain open (#336) | Verify observed events against the published schema without invented events; keep commitments available when the channel is unwired |
| SKOS organization aliases | Catalog binding and chip caption live on #480 / #482 | One catalog row per corroborated org; companion caption is hint-only until bound |
| Event Lineage evidence | Channel evidence and Allen relations live on #387 / #484 | Persist channel scores, explain them in the popup, never invent a fused score |
| Scientific measurement | Durable accepted TEPP receipts and LineageWeave #614's exact accepted snapshot/cutoff/run/pair-count consumer are protected; TEPP #237 remains open, so no registered producer artifact exists yet. #387 removes inferred/default persistence weights, but several older reconstruction tests still pass hand-authored numeric dictionaries that are not estimator evidence | Land TEPP #237 through its protected gate, then replace remaining reconstruction-test constants with provenance-bearing fast-mlsirm estimates over synthetic fixtures. Retain true-parameter RMSE recovery as the acceptance bar |
| Python mathematical-compute boundary | ADR 0208's first deletion slice consumes fast-mlsirm protected-main Rust `residual_interaction_map` and `polytomous_expected_response`; local Gabriel SVD, distance, reconstruction, shares, expected-category and duplicate likelihood formulas are deleted. This stack also removes local RRF contribution arithmetic and corrects the invalid all-ones call to RankWeave's convex API through RankWeave #47 (`f92c3a2c`), but RankWeave #47 is still Python and therefore is not the final Rust CPU/GPU execution contract. The doctoring inventory still names period calibration, channel weighting, cosine, graph ranking, and fusion debt | Land the owner and stacked consumer through protected gates; then move RankWeave's calculation core to Rust CPU/GPU and migrate each remaining construct to its owning repository contract before requiring an empty transition inventory |
| Asynchronous authorization | Protected `main` rebuilds Global Ask worker scope after the bearer token leaves the request; #468 now persists exact Keyverse organization/process-unit scope in 3NF child tables and intersects it with current affiliations | Land #468 through the protected gate; prove a second affiliation and a revoked process unit cannot widen delayed-job evidence |
| Planned-facility intent | Planned-facility relationship intent remains only on closed, unmerged #490; earlier stack-only merges were not protected delivery | Recreate the evidence-backed slice on a current base and land through protected `main` before a release claim |
| Accessibility and responsive UX | #602 delivered base post-detail modal semantics; #605 adds selected-post refocus, collapsed/hidden/inert/CSS-invisible focus exclusion across both modal types, readable evidence separators, focused tests, and desktop/mobile Storybook screenshots | Land #605 through the protected gate, then complete screen-reader and authenticated Playwright acceptance on the exact release head |
| Design tokens and repeated objects | Token extraction started; sanitized Figma Event Lineage desktop/mobile frames exist, while other repeated product surfaces remain incomplete | Tokens in CSS + Storybook stories for board, popup, DAG, Ask, calendar, forms, charts; same-viewport Figma/runtime visual comparison before release |
| Frontend delivery performance | A current production build succeeds but emits Vite's >500 kB chunk warning (`539.27 kB` minified); raising the warning limit would conceal rather than reduce delivery cost | Measure module contribution on an exact head, split one real route/surface boundary with native dynamic import, then prove the warning is absent and loading/error states remain accessible |
| External integrations | Search, Zotero, calendar, Keyverse, orchestrator, RankWeave, ThreadWeave, TEPP, DiskSage, wardnet | Provider conformance, failure/reconciliation behavior, and provenance-bearing integration evidence |
| MSA / modular reuse | LineageWeave must run standalone and as a consumer of org packages | Do not reimplement RankWeave/TEPP/orchestrator/ThreadWeave/Keyverse; fix upstream and PR there |
| Product contract authority | This branch recreates the first LineageWeave PRD after superseded #613 closed without merge and records an exact-case ecosystem authority register; TEPP, fast-mlsirm, keyverse, and ThreadWeave have standalone PRDs, while contextual-orchestrator, RankWeave, DiskSage, and wardnet currently rely on product-planning/architecture documents and naruon has only a scoped Topic Intelligence PRD | Land the LineageWeave PRD, keep ADRs normative, and add standalone PRDs in each owning repository before making cross-product release claims beyond its documented boundary |
| Release quality | The #664/#660 stacked tree passed the complete Python suite (1,352 passed, 17 skipped) after #660 removed a duplicate synthetic snapshot digest and restored the TEPP settings contract. This is local candidate evidence, not protected-main delivery | Repository-wide coverage, frontend/Storybook, security, browser, and protected merge evidence on one exact head |
| PII | Masking would paralyze the product; ADR 0001 forbids identifying artifacts in git | ABAC + authorized runtime; synthetic fixtures in git; no mask-in-place that drops names the operator must read |
| Database | PostgreSQL, 3NF, snake_case ≥ two words, hot-partition and lock policy | No file DBs; read/write split if lock management fails; whitelist every migration |

## 6. UI-UX acceptance inventory (must be defined, reviewed, applied, audited)

Each item needs a Storybook scene, an edge-case story, and an automated check
before a commercial release claim. Figma File ID `1Su3lDRmiZdcUs47t1QwIX`.

| Dimension | Current | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accessibility | Partial labels/roles on board, popup, login | WCAG 2.2 AA on login, board, popup, Ask, calendar, admin; focus order; live regions |
| Touch & Interaction | Click-first popup and lists | 44px targets, swipe/escape to dismiss popup, no hover-only actions |
| Performance | Board caps and hint render limits exist | Interaction-to-next-paint on board search, DAG, Ask; no N+1 (#358) |
| Style Selection | Korean UI standards merged (#347) | Tokenized light/dark; Anti-Slop-UI density; no decorative noise |
| Layout & Responsive | Desktop popup shell | 402px-class phone layout; stacked GNB; readable DAG |
| Typography & Color | Badge tokens extracted | Contrast on badges, links, error/status; no raw hex in components |
| Animation | Minimal | Reduced-motion; no blocking animation on evidence open |
| Forms & Feedback | Login, Ask, tickets, admin brand | Inline validation, next-action copy, unavailable vs failed distinction |
| Navigation Patterns | Board / customers / calendar / Ask / admin | Deep-link post + OIDC return URL (#426); bookmarkable Ask |
| Charts & Data | Period reports, leftover pairs, Rankings, DAG | Honest empty/unavailable; no invented theta; Storybook chart states |

## 7. Ecosystem leverage order

Reuse before rebuild. Consume these ContextualWisdomLab packages in this order
of leverage; open connector PRs there when the defect is upstream:

1. **contextual-orchestrator** — every LLM/VISION/embedding call (Fugu / Conductor / TRINITY routing). Never a raw provider SDK.
2. **Keyverse** — OIDC issuer, JWKS, tenant principals.
3. **RankWeave** — fused scores and rankings; never invent a fused score or theta.
4. **TEPP** — calibrated measurement; persist receipts; no local reimplementation.
5. **fast-mlsirm** — GRM/GPCM/CAT/FIPC recovery tests (#451–#454) must stay true-parameter RMSE.
6. **ThreadWeave** — tree assembly.
7. **Naruon** — calendar and email/project lineage projection (#336, #338, #355).
8. **DiskSage / wardnet** — storage and network policy as needed.
9. **ContextualWisdomLab/.github** — required review workflows (OpenCode, Strix, Noema) and the LineageWeave hourly caller (#1259). If stacked PRs miss central review or coverage-evidence fails on pnpm 9 (`--trust-lockfile` is pnpm 11.3) or a missing Vitest coverage provider, fix the org workflow (#1258), not a local bypass.

## 8. Public ontology publication boundary

- PR #426 publishes fragment-addressable HTML, byte-identical Turtle,
  isomorphic JSON-LD and N-Triples, the PROV-O support profile, and a
  source-digest manifest from the authoritative ontology.
- Pull requests validate only. Only protected `main` may publish, and the
  generated-directory marker, linked-IRI, duplicate-fragment, symlink, and
  source-overlap checks fail closed.
- The lowercase knowledge-graph namespace and repository-case support-profile
  namespace remain distinct until issue #372 delivers a versioned migration
  and compatibility decision; this publication PR rewrites neither identity.
- Until the protected deployment and exact URL checks succeed, the public
  ontology endpoint remains unavailable and must not be represented as live.

## 9. Evidence boundaries

- Never add a real record, title, name, identifier, screenshot, log, benchmark
  artifact, or documentation example to this repository.
- Attendance or co-occurrence is not responsibility, project, customer, or
  affiliation evidence. Preserve uncertainty and provenance.
- Missing transport, model capability, accepted envelope, or persistence is
  unavailable or failed evidence, never a placeholder result.
- Local green tests, bot statuses, auto-merge, and warning-only checks do not
  prove a protected merge.
- Re-fetch base/head SHAs, checks, review threads, approvals, rulesets, and the
  merge SHA immediately before any lifecycle claim.
- Do not self-approve. Independent OpenCode / Strix / Noema review is required.
- Do not force-push. Do not treat GitHub Checks duration as a blocker; repair
  the failing check instead.
- `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` is not used.

## 10. Next acceptance loop (autonomous merge order)

Process every open PR in ascending number order, considering leverage; for
each: check reviews → repair → re-verify Checks → merge → continue. Checks and
review latency are never blockers — keep working while they settle.

1. Revalidate Strix after protected ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1320, reconcile
   .github#1263, and land the atomic hourly LineageWeave caller in .github#1288.
2. Merge #387 and #618–#621 only after each exact head shows terminal
   green required checks plus current-head independent approval.
3. After the queue drains, resume user-visible gaps from §5 in leverage order:
   Event Lineage evidence (#387/#274), Naruon calendar (#355/#336), and
   authenticated operations/ontology publication acceptance.
5. Rename remaining `[Buyer Gap]` issue titles to neutral product-object
   naming per repository convention (no "Buyer" for internal objects).
6. Keep psychometric tests as true-parameter recovery (RMSE); never fixture
   tautologies, invented theta, or hand-authored numeric weights. Remove
   weights from tests that do not exercise fusion; fusion tests must consume
   provenance-bearing fast-mlsirm estimates over synthetic fixtures.
7. Run frontend lint/test/build/Storybook, backend tests, and authenticated
   browser/accessibility checks on the exact candidate release head.
8. Fix only evidence-backed failures and repeat the protected merge gate.
9. Refresh this file each loop with the exact queue state.

# Product & Technical Gap Baseline

## 1. Known Parsing & Frontend Display Gaps
- **Footnote Parsing**: `post=00505695-3e61-1fd1-83c5-263f88a9e77a` fails to recognize footnotes (li/oi level errors).
- **Table Parsing**: `post=00505695-3e61-1fd1-80c6-86bb61c8ddc5` completely fails at parsing tables.
- **Indentation**: Incorrect indentation rendering in `post=00505695-7571-1fd1-83c3-d521b187ad5b` and `post=00505695-3e61-1fd1-83c0-497b3c1c455e`.
- **Image/Table OCR**: `post=00505695-7571-1fd1-83dd-3d22a61a5734` fails text recognition for tables inside images, markdown parsing fails, and image OCR description is too shallow for Ontology & Semantics.
- **Math/Superscripts**: Split by verified sub-claim. *Text extraction* -- (Resolved): checked the real named post (confirmed still present); its `post_body` already uses plain literal caret notation ("m^3") in the source, not HTML `<sup>` markup or Unicode superscript characters (neither appears anywhere in the body). `chunk_by_dom` preserves the literal caret text unchanged in its chunk, with zero data loss -- there is no parsing failure to fix for this specific post. `<sup>` is correctly treated as inline (not a `_DOM_BLOCK_TAGS` entry), so if a future post *does* use real `<sup>` markup, its text would still flow into the parent chunk (not dropped), though the superscript distinction itself is not currently preserved as a semantic marker -- worth revisiting only if a real `<sup>`-using post surfaces this as an actual problem. *"Needs strict Ontology grammar for math formulas"* -- still genuinely open: grepped all of `lineageweave/`/`backend/` for any formula/measurement-grammar handling in the LLM extraction prompts -- zero hits. Defining and integrating a formal math/measurement-expression grammar into the ontology-extraction pipeline is a real, unscoped feature (a new grammar/schema plus prompt and downstream ontology-annotation changes), not something to half-build here -- left open for a properly scoped future effort.
- **Missing UI Elements**: DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) view is currently missing from the frontend for `post=00505695-7571-1fd1-83c5-895ed333cdbc`.

## 2. LLM Extraction & Knowledge Graph Gaps
- **Multiple Project Extraction**: (Resolved) LLM prompt updated to request key_events as objects with project_name, separating events correctly.
- **5W1H Missing**: (Resolved) LLM prompt updated to explicitly request 5W1H evidence items in the JSON output array.
- **R&R and Keyman Missing**: (Resolved) LLM prompt updated to explicitly instruct using actual stated names rather than collective titles.
- **Entity Resolution / Searxng**: Abbreviations like "한전" and "한국전력" are not mapped properly using Searxng and KG corroboration. 
- **Meso-level Team Mapping**: (Resolved) Checked extraction logic; `team` mapping logic is present and correct, but LLM needed better explicit instruction which is covered by R&R resolution.
- **Base64 Image Omni-modal**: Current text-only embedding fails on images. Omni-modal LLM processing is required for images to capture layout, font size, colors, and spatial meaning.

## 3. General Architecture Gaps
- **DB Architecture**: Ensure PostgreSQL is strictly used (no file DBs), 3rd normal form is maintained, and Hot Partitions are handled. DB locks must be managed (or use read/write replicas).
- **Zotero Integration**: Papers and standards referenced by TEPP must be synced via Local Zotero API (http://localhost:23119/api/) and cited using APA 7th edition in docstrings.
- **Testing**: We need actual testing of Psychometrics (Fast-MLSIRM parameter calibration, RMSE of estimates, Fixed-Item Parameter Calibration, CAT) against synthetic/demo data.
- **Security & Compliance**: PII masking cannot break the system. Need SOC 2 and CSAP compliance alternatives to blind PII masking. 
- **LLM Orchestration**: Ensure ALL LLM calls route through `contextual-orchestrator` utilizing API keys (BYTEZ, NVIDIA, OPENROUTER, OPENAI) with auto model discovery and optimal reasoning effort allocation (Fugu/Conductor/TRINITY research).

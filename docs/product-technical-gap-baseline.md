## 1. Exact-head and governance evidence

The protected default branch was `3f4734806bdc7ef5843f36c7dbbcceb62cd51b9e`
when this baseline was refreshed. The live queue contained 3 open PRs and 17
open issues. The exact-head inventory below supersedes older per-PR snapshots
elsewhere in this document; those older rows remain useful historical delivery
context only.

| PR | Exact observed head | Merge/check state at this snapshot |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| #612 | `85bdcadb` | this post-#609 follow-up clears the previous focused graph during navigation so another post's isolation reason cannot flash; the documentation amendment necessarily supersedes this observed pre-amendment SHA, and auto-merge remains subject to restarted exact-head gates and review |
| #579 | `9de161ef` | interaction-map coordinates are mergeable on the current head; hosted gates and independent exact-head review remain outstanding |
| #387 | `ab5cf345` | channel evidence plus Ask reconstruction-profile preservation is mergeable on the current head, but a current changes-requested decision remains; resolve valid findings and obtain independent exact-head re-review before enabling auto-merge |

No row above is merge evidence. Immediately before any lifecycle action,
re-fetch the head, unresolved threads, formal reviews, rulesets, and same-head
check conclusions. In particular, queued checks are infrastructure state and
do not transfer evidence from an earlier SHA.

PR #607 first merged as `61fd631c7bb3c57113fd19763c2c43161eeb2824`
into #606's non-default branch. The complete stack subsequently passed the
protected gate and #606 merged to `main` as
`3f4734806bdc7ef5843f36c7dbbcceb62cd51b9e`.

PR #604 was closed unmerged after its exact OIDC repair was composed into #605;
its green or pending checks are not delivery evidence. PR #482 merged as
protected-main commit `464ff25002044b9d933c8eefd36c8def7ca0ffd8`
with package conflict markers, identifying baseline records, and an OIDC
return-context regression. PR #603 repaired the package/privacy and
analysis-run transaction defects through protected main at `4f53190b`; #605
subsequently delivered the composed OIDC repair through the protected gate.

PR #592 first merged as `3b3af3b4fe9c439354433a43444e05f37ab24ea3`
into #590's non-default stack base at `2f033ba3`. The complete stack then
passed the protected gate and #590 merged to `main` as
`1d1379fc59d9dac6e9c8bfa4812313e3b9e8f3c8`.

PR #521 merged through protected `main` as
`3797f063b1a7396972a749aa81f23745acccbee1`; it is release evidence and no
longer part of the open queue. That merge also left a standalone conflict
marker and duplicated stale tail in `CLAUDE.md`; #594 repaired it through
protected `main` as `241be2dddf657f854cb8be54fe11d4ef48d37976`.

Protected main now calls the ADR 0109 OIDC return helpers before
`signinRedirect`; #600 and #605 delivered the repair through the protected
gate. The authenticated-only `accessToken` narrowing remains present.

Three systemic gates currently dominate the queue:

1. **Strix visibility lookup failure (org control plane).** PR #600 exact head
   `7580bdc9` failed before scanning because the required-workflow token could
   not resolve this public repository after six API retries. The root repair is
   ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1320 at `3b9b2380`: ordinary PR, push, and
   schedule runs use trusted event visibility; cross-repository dispatch keeps
   authoritative public/private/internal visibility; private and internal
   repositories remain on private-capable providers. The exact head also
   composes the executable fallback contract and classifies bounded NVIDIA
   `ServiceUnavailableError` overload evidence as retryable across configured
   distinct models without weakening exhaustion or vulnerability fail-close.
   A hosted fallback then completed with zero vulnerabilities but was rejected
   because the generic warning gate treated Strix's fallback-model banner and
   a Hugging Face unauthenticated-download notice as provider failures. The
   current head removes only those two exact scanner notices before the
   existing general warning and explicit 429/provider failure checks. The
   current head also clears a foreign NVIDIA/OpenRouter endpoint before a
   direct-OpenAI fallback while retaining an explicitly configured
   direct-OpenAI primary endpoint. The prior full quick-gate harness, overload
   path, 12 visibility-contract tests, and the focused cross-provider endpoint
   contract passed; exact-head hosted revalidation remains pending. It is blocked on
   hosted exact-head gates and independent review, so no repaired
   protected-main Strix runtime evidence exists yet.
2. **Strix provider unavailability (org control plane).** The central required
   Strix scan on .github#1320 failed when NVIDIA returned `Service temporarily
   overloaded`; the gate correctly failed closed but did not try its configured
   distinct fallbacks because the service-unavailable classifier excluded the
   NVIDIA provider. Exact head `3b9b2380` composes that execution repair and the
   two exact non-fatal scanner-notice exclusions while keeping
   incomplete exhaustion non-passing. This is still an unmerged control-plane
   proposal, not protected-main or downstream runtime evidence.
3. **Current-head independent approval.** The org merge scheduler requires
   `reviewDecision == APPROVED` plus complete Strix evidence on the exact
   head. Bot review evidence regenerates per push, so any repair push resets
   the review clock by design; this is expected and not a bypass target.

Recent protected-default-branch delivery evidence (squash merges onto

This documentation is owned by protected `main` again: the #426 stack landed,
so hidden-stack merges (#494, #497, #499, #505, #509 into unprotected parent
branches) are historical context only and no longer gate anything.

The current protected-`main` and exact #507 trees are clean of the private
runtime source-table identifier present in the closed #506 head and older
public history. Do not reproduce or hint at its value. Historical remediation
requires the ADR 0001 incident process and security/privacy-owner coordination;
never force-push or delete evidence ad hoc.

The Grok durable hourly loop and the central thin GitHub Actions caller
ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1259 (minute 4, `pr-review-fix-scheduler.yml`)
both target this repository. Do not add a LineageWeave-local duplicate
workflow. ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1258 merged at exact head `897819c4` to
repair the pnpm/coverage-evidence workflow; newly created exact PR heads must
still prove the runtime behavior because merged workflow source alone is not
check evidence.

Figma design-system boundary (ADR 0002): File ID `1Su3lDRmiZdcUs47t1QwIX`.
The sanitized file now contains synthetic Event Lineage desktop (`5:14`) and
mobile (`5:15`) frames with graph direction, event dates, an inference
boundary, and exact fused-score evidence. Do not copy source-organization
content into this repository. Storybook remains the executable scene and
edge-case inventory for repeated web objects; rendered code-to-Figma parity
still requires same-viewport browser comparison on an exact candidate head.

## 2. User-visible capability baseline

Substantially present on protected `main`:

- PostgreSQL-backed import, normalized provenance, cutoff-aware analysis runs,
  source revisions, lineage reconstruction, and explicit unavailable states.
- Authenticated workspace navigation, post detail, localized summaries, 5W1H,
  R&R/Keyman, evidence citations, chat, organization hierarchy, and lineage DAG
  (`frontend/src/LineageDag.tsx` is on `main`; the old “DAG view missing”
  baseline entry is stale).
- Semantic paragraph/list/table/image-region units that preserve the source
  representation and provenance instead of flattening it into one body string.
- Contextual-orchestrator boundaries for adjudication, extraction, summaries,
  chat, embeddings, and VISION; null channels remain unavailable and are
  dropped from score fusion.
- W3C PROV-O projection through normalized provenance tables, with the
  knowledge graph retained as an explicit navigation projection.
- Keyverse/Keycloak OIDC, RankWeave fusion port, TEPP measurement client,
  ThreadWeave tree assembly.

These statements describe source capability, not authenticated production
corpus acceptance or protected release.

## 3. Historical open-PR inventory (superseded by §1)

Heads below are queue evidence captured at snapshot time; recheck SHA,
checks, unresolved threads, and independent approval immediately before any
merge claim. Do not self-approve, force-push, or transfer stale review
evidence across heads. The org merge scheduler merges only when
`reviewDecision == APPROVED` on the exact head and Strix evidence is complete.

### 3.0 Shared systemic gate

| Gate | Evidence | Durable repair |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strix provider unavailability | `nvidia_nim/nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` and `openai-direct/gpt-5.6-luna` failed authoritatively across unrelated heads | ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1263 at `ab3d7645` proposes executable Azure/cross-provider fallbacks but remains open/conflicting; repair that branch without weakening the required gate |
| ADR 0109 login repair debt | Eight branches cut from the pre-repair base carried the unauthenticated `AdminPanel` + unused-OIDC-helper `tsc -b` failure | Same verified two-line repair applied to #521, #522, #552, #553, #554, #556, #558, #560 during this loop; frontend lint/test/build verified locally |

### 3.1 Workspace root and product surfaces

| PR | Head | Intent | Notes |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| #258 | `f0b5234d` | Workspace evidence board and source-grounded ontology surface (root stack) | Largest surface; historical CHANGES_REQUESTED is stale relative to current head |

| #493 | `499c8b1b` | Name Event Lineage isolation reasons (v2.16.0) | Honest unavailable/failed states |

### 3.2 SKOS organization aliases and leftover-map family (stacked)

| PR | Head | Intent |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| #480 | `f18b421d` | Bind corroborated SKOS org aliases to one catalog row |
| #482 | `c38c08d6` | Corroborated SKOS companion caption on organization chips (v2.14.0) |
| #481 | `32944979` | Persist leftover interaction-map coordinates (v2.12.7) |
| #485 | `dcaa6320` | Leftover pair clicks land on the named Post quality criterion (v2.12.8) |
| #518 | `3117823f` | Name leftover complete-case coverage (v2.12.17) |
| #519 | `31c150c8` | Persist leftover-map axis share on period reports (v2.12.16) |
| #521 | `40677c75` | Leftover pairs on the grouping comparison strip (v2.12.17) |

| #563 | `740d50f3` | Name leftover-map cross share (v2.12.29) |
| #564 | `ac5de72a` | Name leftover-map reconstruction share (v2.12.30) |

The leftover-map naming series (#518–#564) is a stacked ladder of honest
leftover-pair labeling increments; merge in ascending order once each exact
head clears gates.

### 3.3 Repairs and operability

| PR | Head | Intent |

| #558 | `91dd1bfc` | Bare loading text exposed as live regions |
| #560 | `59b769e3` | Secondary details/summary toggles sized to `--size-control-min` |

### 3.4 Integration and measurement boundary

| PR | Head | Intent |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| #417 | `cb08377c` | TEPP topic-lineage consumption boundary (TRSL-TM + CHRONOS/TDT) ADR |
| #468 | `228f13dd` | Bind fast-mlsirm, Keyverse, orchestrator, and TEPP integration tests |
| #258-family measurement note | — | GRM/GPCM/CAT/FIPC parameter recovery (#451–#454) landed earlier; true-parameter RMSE remains the acceptance bar |

### 3.5 Documentation

| PR | Intent |
| ---: | --- |
| #565 | Sync AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md with accepted ADR boundaries |
| this file | Non-identifying gap baseline refresh (ADR 0001) |

Closed as superseded during this loop: #368 (baseline rewrite superseded by
this file per §3.5 of the prior snapshot).

## 4. Open issues (complete live queue; product acceptance remaining on `main`)

| Issue | User-visible gap | Active PR |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| #79 | Milestone 2: port verified direct-PostgreSQL analysis into the protected architecture | analysis-run registry on `main`; remaining runtime bridge |
| #87 | Milestone 2.1 normalized runtime-analysis schema bridge | related analysis-run work |

| #363 | Continue ontology neighborhoods beyond the bounded source window | Ask / ontology |
| #372 | Reconcile lowercase and repository-case public namespace IRIs | #426 Pages stack; #492 is merged into that branch, not protected `main` |

## 5. Open product and technical gaps

| Gap | Current evidence | Acceptance requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protected release | 3 open PRs at snapshot; #612 and #579 are mergeable while #387 retains changes requested | Terminal exact-head checks, no unresolved threads, independent exact-head approvals, protected squash-merge SHA |
| Evidence-grounded operations workspace | Protected-main #606 delivers persisted operational cases, an authenticated dashboard, citation-first actions, report/alert delivery metadata, tokens, Storybook, and regression coverage; authenticated production backfill and the similar-VOC live endpoint remain unavailable | Perform authenticated desktop/mobile acceptance with aggregate evidence and deliver the live similar-VOC endpoint before claiming that subfeature |
| Shared frontend gate | The ADR 0109 login repair is on protected `main`; eight older branches carried the defect and received the same verified repair this loop (#521–#560) | Keep every future branch cut from post-repair bases; re-verify with frontend lint/test/build before push |
| Identifying baseline regression | `main` gap file listed real post identifiers; separately, closed #506 and pre-existing public history contain a private runtime source-table identifier, while current `main` and #507 trees are clean | Land this non-identifying rewrite, then coordinate ADR 0001 history remediation with security/privacy owners; do not reproduce the value, force-push, or delete evidence ad hoc |
| Authorized-corpus runtime | Repository tests use synthetic fixtures; private records remain outside git | Authenticated runtime validation returning only aggregate, non-identifying evidence |
| Image understanding | Region, OCR, and description work exists across active heads (#405, #419), but current runtime acceptance has not yet proved table-image structure, complete region coverage, or summary/image readiness together | Orchestrator-backed rendered workflow, original/derived asset provenance, region-before-OCR processing, and honest unsupported states; reconcile ADR 0052's image-bearing summary readiness with ADR 0098 before changing sequencing |
| Semantic source rendering | Paragraph, table, list, formula, and indentation work exists across stacks (#394, #427, #448–#450); #515 adds synthetic backend/frontend parity for deterministic rows/cells, footnote boundaries, and encoded scripts | Land the #427 → #515 stack, then gather authenticated browser evidence that list nesting, continuation alignment, and formula units render without authoring-layout artifacts |
| Event and project semantics | Multi-project mentions, project-bound actions, 5W1H, requester/processor, and semantic relations exist in ADR 0036/0052/0100/0111/0129 and active stacks | Aggregate authenticated evidence must show distinct projects and events, explicit requester/processor and real R&R, normalized relative time, and product/entity relations without promoting attendance or co-occurrence |
| Knowledge Graph readability | The black evidence-node root cause is an undefined-token fallback; the design-token repair and long-label/evidence-table coverage are present on #490, not protected `main` | Deliver the token repair through protected `main`, then verify light/dark contrast, keyboard graph navigation, full labels, and evidence tables in the authenticated rendered surface |
| Source-code lookup UX | Source state/detail codes remain evidence-bearing machine values and current detail presentation is dense | Catalog-backed display labels with raw-code provenance, compact 5W1H/source-detail hierarchy, keyboard access, and no unsupported customer/project binding |
| Calendar / Naruon | #355 delivered the projection contract; v2.17.0 wires Buyer consume without forwarding the end-user token. Naruon producer, provider/consumer fixtures, and protected merge remain open (#336) | Verify observed events against the published schema without invented events; keep commitments available when the channel is unwired |
| SKOS organization aliases | Catalog binding and chip caption live on #480 / #482 | One catalog row per corroborated org; companion caption is hint-only until bound |
| Event Lineage evidence | Channel evidence and Allen relations live on #387 / #484 | Persist channel scores, explain them in the popup, never invent a fused score |
| Scientific measurement | Durable accepted TEPP receipts are protected (`main`); #606 replaces the internally anchored channel-weight activation with the exact TEPP-owned criterion-validity contract from TEPP#237, while #468 binds fast-mlsirm/Keyverse/orchestrator/TEPP integration tests and fails closed on upstream probability-axis drift. Neither cross-repository PR is protected delivery yet. #387 removes inferred/default persistence weights, but several older reconstruction tests still pass hand-authored numeric weight dictionaries; those constants are not estimator evidence | Land TEPP#237 before or together with #606 through their protected gates, then continue replacing remaining reconstruction-test constants with provenance-bearing fast-mlsirm estimates over synthetic fixtures; tests unrelated to fusion must bypass weighting entirely, as #484 does. Retain true-parameter RMSE recovery as the acceptance bar |
| Asynchronous authorization | Protected `main` rebuilds Global Ask worker scope after the bearer token leaves the request; #468 now persists exact Keyverse organization/process-unit scope in 3NF child tables and intersects it with current affiliations | Land #468 through the protected gate; prove a second affiliation and a revoked process unit cannot widen delayed-job evidence |
| Planned-facility intent | Planned-facility relationship intent rides on open #490 (`d0cad030`), whose earlier stack-only merges were not protected delivery | Settle #490 exact-head checks plus independent approval, then land through protected `main` before a release claim |
| Accessibility and responsive UX | #602 and protected-main #605 deliver modal semantics, selected-post refocus, collapsed/hidden/inert/CSS-invisible focus exclusion, and readable evidence separators | Complete screen-reader and authenticated Playwright acceptance on one exact release head |
| Design tokens and repeated objects | Token extraction started; sanitized Figma Event Lineage desktop/mobile frames exist, while other repeated product surfaces remain incomplete | Tokens in CSS + Storybook stories for board, popup, DAG, Ask, calendar, forms, charts; same-viewport Figma/runtime visual comparison before release |
| External integrations | Search, Zotero, calendar, Keyverse, orchestrator, RankWeave, ThreadWeave, TEPP, disksage, wardnet | Provider conformance, failure/reconciliation behavior, and provenance-bearing integration evidence |
| MSA / modular reuse | LineageWeave must run standalone and as a consumer of org packages | Do not reimplement RankWeave/TEPP/orchestrator/ThreadWeave/Keyverse; fix upstream and PR there |
| Release quality | Local focused/full suites have passed on individual PR heads | Repository-wide coverage, docstrings, Storybook, security, browser, and release evidence on one exact head |
| PII | Masking would paralyze the product; ADR 0001 forbids identifying artifacts in git | ABAC + authorized runtime; synthetic fixtures in git; no mask-in-place that drops names the operator must read |
| Database | PostgreSQL, 3NF, snake_case ≥ two words, hot-partition and lock policy | No file DBs; read/write split if lock management fails; whitelist every migration |

## 6. UI-UX acceptance inventory (must be defined, reviewed, applied, audited)

Each item needs a Storybook scene, an edge-case story, and an automated check
before a commercial release claim. Figma File ID `1Su3lDRmiZdcUs47t1QwIX`.

| Dimension | Current | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- |

## 7. Ecosystem leverage order

Reuse before rebuild. Consume these ContextualWisdomLab packages in this order
of leverage; open connector PRs there when the defect is upstream:

1. **contextual-orchestrator** — every LLM/VISION/embedding call (Fugu / Conductor / TRINITY routing). Never a raw provider SDK.
2. **Keyverse** — OIDC issuer, JWKS, tenant principals.
3. **RankWeave** — fused scores and rankings; never invent a fused score or theta.
4. **TEPP** — calibrated measurement; persist receipts; no local reimplementation.
5. **fast-mlsirm** — GRM/GPCM/CAT/FIPC recovery tests (#451–#454) must stay true-parameter RMSE.
6. **ThreadWeave** — tree assembly.
7. **Naruon** — calendar and email/project lineage projection (#336, #338, #355).
8. **disksage / wardnet** — storage and network policy as needed.
9. **ContextualWisdomLab/.github** — required review workflows (OpenCode, Strix, Noema) and the LineageWeave hourly caller (#1259). If stacked PRs miss central review or coverage-evidence fails on pnpm 9 (`--trust-lockfile` is pnpm 11.3) or a missing Vitest coverage provider, fix the org workflow (#1258), not a local bypass.

## 8. Public ontology publication boundary

- PR #426 publishes fragment-addressable HTML, byte-identical Turtle,
  isomorphic JSON-LD and N-Triples, the PROV-O support profile, and a
  source-digest manifest from the authoritative ontology.
- Pull requests validate only. Only protected `main` may publish, and the
  generated-directory marker, linked-IRI, duplicate-fragment, symlink, and
  source-overlap checks fail closed.
- The lowercase knowledge-graph namespace and repository-case support-profile
  namespace remain distinct until issue #372 delivers a versioned migration
  and compatibility decision; this publication PR rewrites neither identity.
- Until the protected deployment and exact URL checks succeed, the public
  ontology endpoint remains unavailable and must not be represented as live.

## 9. Evidence boundaries

- Never add a real record, title, name, identifier, screenshot, log, benchmark
  artifact, or documentation example to this repository.
- Attendance or co-occurrence is not responsibility, project, customer, or
  affiliation evidence. Preserve uncertainty and provenance.
- Missing transport, model capability, accepted envelope, or persistence is
  unavailable or failed evidence, never a placeholder result.
- Local green tests, bot statuses, auto-merge, and warning-only checks do not
  prove a protected merge.
- Re-fetch base/head SHAs, checks, review threads, approvals, rulesets, and the
  merge SHA immediately before any lifecycle claim.
- Do not self-approve. Independent OpenCode / Strix / Noema review is required.
- Do not force-push. Do not treat GitHub Checks duration as a blocker; repair
  the failing check instead.
- `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` is not used.

## 10. Next acceptance loop (autonomous merge order)

Process every open PR in ascending number order, considering leverage; for
each: check reviews → repair → re-verify Checks → merge → continue. Checks and
review latency are never blockers — keep working while they settle.

1. **Unblock Strix org-wide** by landing ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1320
   (trusted event visibility), then reconciling ContextualWisdomLab/.github#1263
   (fallbacks executable), and rerun failed Strix jobs across the queue.
2. Merge ascending from #258 once each head shows terminal green required
   checks plus current-head independent approval. The leftover-map ladder
   (#518–#564) merges in ascending order.
3. Keep the shared ADR 0109 repair verified on #521–#560 heads (done this
   loop; frontend lint/test/build passed locally before each push).
4. After PRs drain below a handful, resume buyer-visible gaps from §5 in
   leverage order: Event Lineage evidence (#387/#274), Naruon calendar
   (#355/#336), SKOS aliases (#480/#482), ontology explorer (#349/#341).
5. Rename remaining `[Buyer Gap]` issue titles to neutral product-object
   naming per repository convention (no "Buyer" for internal objects).
6. Keep psychometric tests as true-parameter recovery (RMSE); never fixture
   tautologies, invented theta, or hand-authored numeric weights. Remove
   weights from tests that do not exercise fusion; fusion tests must consume
   provenance-bearing fast-mlsirm estimates over synthetic fixtures.
7. Run frontend lint/test/build/Storybook, backend tests, and authenticated
   browser/accessibility checks on the exact candidate release head.
8. Fix only evidence-backed failures and repeat the protected merge gate.
9. Refresh this file each loop with the exact queue state.
